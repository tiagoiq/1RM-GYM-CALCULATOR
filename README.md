# 1RM Calculator - Real Time Gym Strength Estimator

This is a desktop application developed in Java that allows you to calculate your estimated 1 Rep Max (1RM) in real time at the gym.

## What is 1RM?
1RM stands for "One Repetition Maximum" — the maximum weight you can lift for a single repetition of a given exercise.

## How does it work?
You just need to enter:
- The weight you lifted (kg)
- The number of repetitions you performed

The application will instantly calculate your estimated 1RM using the Epley formula:
1RM = (Peso levantado * 0,033 * repeticiones al fallo) + Peso levantado.

You only need to enter:
- The weight lifted (in kg)
- The number of repetitions completed

Then, you'll instantly get your estimated maximum strength 💪
